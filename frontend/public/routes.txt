rcfe->react componenet shortcut for snippet
once we have created the nav , banner , footer , freebok(for free courses filter from list.json using javascript method ) and map the tailwind css cards with
the freebook to dislplay only free cards -> our home page is almost ready ./ 
-> now we need to move to courses page but before this we need to decide route for each page , like homwpage -
localhost:5173 -> home page, for course page -> localhost:5173./courses and similarly for the other pages 
like aboutus ->localhost:/aboutus
-> so for each page we need to decide the route 
// for that we will create component course.jsx in our componnet
// after this it will not show as we haven't bind it in our app.jsx
-> as we know that we are in home page so we will 
/*
import React from 'react';
import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
import Banner from './components/Banner';
import Footer from './components/footer';
import Freebook from './components/Freebook';

function App() {
  //for tailwind css we use classname , atrribute
  return (
  //   <div>App
  //     <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline"> 
  //       {/* to check whether our tailwind css is working or not */}
  //   Hello world!
  // </h1>
  //   </div>
  <>
  <Navbar></Navbar>
  <Banner></Banner>
  <Freebook></Freebook>
  <Footer></Footer>
  </>
  )
}
*/
-> all this is part of home page -> ./ 
//we will create a folder in src -> homepage -> under it componenet as Home.jsx
// now bring all the above comoponent here in home.jsx like -> 
/*<>
  <Navbar></Navbar>
  <Banner></Banner>
  <Freebook></Freebook>
  <Footer></Footer>
  </>
  */
  ->also there imports
  ->now we as bydefault have homepage -> ./
  ->for other page we need to route it using -> [ npm i react-router-dom]
  // u check it in the package.json in dependices once it gets installed
  ->"react-router-dom": "^7.9.5",
  // we can also react-slick and react carousel as we have installed
  /*

  //as we have route all the pages so import the route after installing it
import { Routes , Route} from "react-router-dom"

  // now we will route and will have our route
  // we route  path="/" ->path -> the page we want to render we want to render home compnent so write it
  // component -> in our element={</home>} -> we want ./ to be rendered as home component like 
  //http://localhost:5173/ -> ./ ->home page 
  //localhost:5173/course -> /courses -> course page 

  <>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home></Home>}/>
    <Route path="/course" element={<Course></Course>}/>
  </Routes>
  */

// if after routing the compoent if doesn't shows 
//if this doesn't gets run that -> we need to remove strict mode from main.jsx 
// beacuse due to strict mode in jsx it render two times so just remove it

// in main page after removing srtrict 
/*
<React.StrictMode>
</app>
</React.StrictMode>

// we will use browser route 
//in main.jsx to render our root element -> app.jsx

  ->as building app we build all this pages and added directly to our app , but as far we know bydeafult 
  we are in our homepage and we have component of our app.jsx like courses,aboutus,contact -> so we have to add 
  these all to our main app.jsx so all these nav, banner,freecourse, footer is is our home page and 
  we want to display now each page from home to contact us as a separate page and also route them, so when we click
  on to those page present on our home page as well as other pages too on our app.jsx on click then they take us to 
  exact courses page 
  now as we have separate home component -> home.jsx

  // we also need to bind the navbar items to our main jsx where we have route this all 
  // when its clicked over here like on course u will be redirected to the course page from the navbar
  //<li><a>Home</a></li> -> <li><a href="./">Home</a></li> for all pages
  // <li><a href='./'>Home</a></li> -> these route  home page 
  // <li><a href='./course'>Course</a></li> // these route has course, course.jsx in app.jsx and we are running this app.jsx in main.jsx as </app> component in the 
  // webrowser when we click it we will be redirected to the course
  // if we go to diff pages that means are component is rendering on route

  // now we want navbar and footer also in our course section 
  //so we will create a foler -> courses-> file name under it courses.jsx
  //add these ther
  /*<Navbar></Navbar>
    <Course></Course>
    <Footer></Footer>*/
  // this will display for courses page
  // on the main jsx just route the ./course path to </courses>

after that we will get ready our courses page , where we have ttile, para and button after that we have to 
render the books .. as we have course.jsx which we are using int the courses.jsx main course section as after 
nav
course
footer
/ we alredy have list.json all book so how we want it to be in course so we can render it in the courses.jsx 
create a main div in course and we will map data over there 
// we already have card component so we will use it 
import list from "../../public/list.json"
use this and map fucntion to map the cards
<div>
        {
         list.map((item)=>
        <Cards key={item.id} item={item}></Cards>)
        }
      </div>
// now it showing one below one so to show it properly we would use css class
// we can use flex , but we will use grid like for small device only 1 cards column 1 anzd for device above md - 4 cards

// now we will look after the hover that scale , on point mouse on it , it get popped or get bit in size
// these need to be done into main cards.jsx which we have mapped with our list.json using it and rendering it 
<div className="card bg-base-100 w-120 shadow-lg rounded-lg hover:scale-105 duration-200">
->hover:scale-105 duration-200

// now as we know that our bacl button is not working so we will use react link 
import {link} from 'react-router-dom'
// place between the link and we will route to our home page back 
// as we know in our app.jsx ./ is rendered as -><Route path="/" element={<Home></Home>}/>
<Link to="/">
<button className='bg-indigo-500 items-enter text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-indigo-700 duration-300 mt-6'>Back</button>
</Link>
// now as we click so we will be redirected to our home 

// know we will create dark and light functionality 
// the button is in our navbar
// we will use theme variable in our navbar 
const[theme,SetTheme]
// theme is variable 
//settheme is a fucntion -> we will keep our changes affect then we will store the value of settheme func into theme var
// we will use usestate where bydefault value will be 
// localstorage of browser , if there is this theme is localstorage so return this as it 
  const[theme,SetTheme]=useState(localStorage.getItem("theme"))?localStorage.getItem("theme"):"light")
  //i.e esle return light
  // just go onto inspect and scroll and go to the application and clcik on the host and on the that website 
  // click on the theme button it will change u can see it , on clicking
  // key    value
  // theme   dark
  // theme   light
// so we will update vlaue on our website so the value od theme gets updated on click
// so we will target browser root element
//const element=document.documentElement;
  // now we have element in our variable ,now we will show affect on click
  we will use [theme]->empty depedencies so it will show only one time not again and again and run on our click
  const[theme,SetTheme]=useState(localStorage.getItem("theme")?localStorage.getItem("theme"):"light")
  const element=document.documentElement;
  useEffect(()=>{
    if(theme==='dark'){
      element.classList.add("dark");
      localStorage.setItem("theme","dark");
      document.body.classList.add("dark");
    }
    else{
      element.classList.remove("dark");
      localStorage.setItem("theme","light");
      document.body.classList.remove("dark");
    }
  },[])
  if theme = dark , so in our element classlist add dark, and set local storage theme dark ,
  so on click on button if theme =dark , so add that to our element and also set it the local storage =dark 
  //document.body.classList.add("dark"); set our boy to dark
  so our website will also become dark
  else part is jsut reverse of these , we will remove dark so bydefault it is light so all , remove from  classlist of element,
  //so also remove from body
  // now we will add the theme to our  theme button in the sun icon part , to change state using hook as we have store the settheme in theme
  //Onclick={()=>SetTheme(theme==='dark'?"light":"dark")}
  / where on click if theme is dark set to light else keep it dark
  // now we will add the theme to our  theme button in the moon icon part , to change state using hook as we have store the settheme in theme
  //Onclick={()=>SetTheme(theme==='light'?"dark":"light")}
  / where on click if theme is light set to dark else keep it light
// after this we need to configure it in the tailwind.config.js
// so to bring ligh/dark theme into effect
//  darkMode:"class", -> our selector would be class as we are using in the class
// in app.jsx ,  <div className='dark:bg-slate-900 dark:text-white'>
 <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home></Home>}/>
    <Route path="/course" element={<Courses></Courses>}/>
  </Routes>
  </div>
// to make changes in the the div of every page to show the dark mode effect so it work evenly so alog with them
// light theme also include 
// dark:bg-slate-900 dark-text-white
// this will reflect only after enabling the dark mode 
// on light mode u will see normally the girl bydefault 

// now we will work on login and registers as there is login in home page and when login opens there register a seperate pg for registration
// so when u go onto course u need login -> but as u are first time on the login so u need to register on the page
// create -> component folder -> login.jsx for login
inside login use component from daisy ui -> modal ->Dialog modal with a close button at corner
    // this daisy ui modal on click it gets open
// this daisy ui modal on click it gets open
    // we will us id="my_modal_3 in our navbar ( beacuse login button is on navbar)
    // on click in navbar it will open login button nad will use showmodal() function to show that modal 
    // use <Login></Login> to import it so we can use login in our navbar
    // now on click -> we will get message like -> Press ESC key or click on ✕ button to close
    // we will further start developing login form and also adding register form along with it 
    / we want email , pass , login button , notresgistered , signup bt
/ we have built these all in div using form and have given css using classname accordingly
    // as we have built the login form now we habe signup on clicking which the route changes so make signup.jsx
    // as login is on same page so we don't define route but for signup as the page changes we have too define the route
    // so it will get open on new page we need to connnect with signup with signup.jsx so we will route in our app.jsx
    //    <Route path='/signup' element={<Signup></Signup>}
// for route we need link so we will signup in link section
</div>
    <div className='flex justify-around mt-6 ml-6' >
        <button className='text-white bg-indigo-600 border rounded-md px-3 py-1 hover:bg-indigo-700 duration-200 '>Login</button>
       <Link to="/Signup" className='mx-20 justify-center'> Not Registered{"?"}<span className='underline text-blue-500 cursor-pointer'>Signup</span>
      </Link>
    </div>
//will be routed to signup jsx using link after routing it 
//now on clicking login bt on navbar it will open the login from and there we can click
// on the signup it will take us to the signup where we have signup.jsx page 
//http://localhost:5173/Signup


// fo r building signup page 
//// we will use same modal use in login in signuo to save our time 
  // we will remove dailog as in this page we don't want to open anything 
  // change it to div , because we want atleast the id , for routing so we can target this 
  // where in navbar we have used this to target the this modal and fucntion to show this 
  // but for now for signup we will use it for the route
  // in signup we need bit changes we don't need anything related to modal so remove it 
  // give css accordigly here now registered \?signup-> becomeshave account ?login 
  // here we have redirected user from signup to login in case if he has a account 
  //we will add x -> back option to go back which not in signup form
  // now we use modal box as we find out that to bring these cross-> back to home functionality
  //as modal -> dailog box already has all css essentials design structures
  // in main div after the react fragment div we will remove modal from there as we don't 
  //have requirement of opeing it there as modal box like insignup 
  //like -> <div className='flex h-screen items-center justify-center '>
    <div className='w-600px'>
  <div className="modal-box">
    <form method="dailog">
  // and also using react route dom we will redirect the with link to home page as for cross
    //and now we will route our login page i f u have account in singup page 
// we will use onclick in link in the login  that is underline in singup to redirect to the login page
// connect all the cross button on each page signup, navabar and also login , so they could be redirected 
// vice versa , and also all the cross has to be working , with the help of link route it to onclick 
// redirect to home page 

// front end work is done 

//now backend related part so , now we want like we enter vlaue in our login or signup should be stored
// in the database -> we work on this 
// -> login page
// when we fill it in case it is empty there should be a validation that says this field is empty -> error
// and without filling it should be submitted to when clicked on to the login 

// for this we will use react hook form 
// got on to the wesbite ->react hook form  , and get started 
//Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
// in cmd ->npm install react-hook-form
// in pkg.json ->    "react-hook-form": "^7.66.0",
// after that imoprt  , login .jsx 
//->import { useForm, SubmitHandler } from "react-hook-form"
// in form  <form method="dialog">, in login.jsx add ->
// <form  onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} method="dialog"
// we need to define the function handle submit 

/ we will copy the below variable from the react hook from website from the jsx code 
const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    // watch, -> we don't need this 
    formState: { errors }, // to show error 
  } = useForm<Inputs>();

  // paste before return and under the react function()
  //in input field we need this  < input type="email> </input>
  //{...register("exampleRequired", { required: true })}
  // 1.first field is email 
  //{...register("email", { required: true })}
  //-> email -> will be true , so email is needed without it will throw error 
  //2. for password , same for {...register("password", { required: true })}
  // so -> pass will be true , for validation 
// {errors.password && <span className='text-sm text-red-500'>This field is required</span>}
// this make sure u don't leave anyfield will give u a warning and login button won't be submitted
//
//now we will do same thing for register.jsx as it is 
// if u just submitted without filling for all the field or any field it will give error , This field Required 
// message in red color and medium text set by us in css

// after submitting the data in login or signup form u can inspect website and check the console.log 
// u can see the value as we submit
/*
 Form Submitted: {email: 'tangentgamer07@gmail.com', password: 'xvxvxd'}
email
:"tangentgamer07@gmail.com"
password
: "xvxvxd"
[[Prototype]]: xsaObject
*/
// we can use mongo db for this but we have libraries in react
